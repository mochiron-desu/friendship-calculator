Welcome to the _pinnacle_ of technological achievement, the Friendship Calculator! Because in this digital age, who has time for genuine human connection when an algorithm can do it for you?

## 🚀 Features That Will Revolutionize Your Social Life

- **Name Input**: Yes, you read that right. This cutting-edge application allows you to enter TWO WHOLE NAMES. We know, contain your excitement.

- **Advanced Calculation Algorithm**: Our state-of-the-art algorithm uses the latest in... counting letters. It's practically AI!

- **Percentage Display**: Witness the magic as our calculator quantifies your friendship into a meaningless number. Because that's totally how relationships work.

- **Confetti Explosion**: For those rare friendships that break the 100% barrier, enjoy a whopping 3 seconds of digital confetti. It's almost as exciting as watching paint dry!

- **Floating Messages**: Experience the thrill of a pop-up message telling you how strong your friendship is. It's like a fortune cookie, but less tasty and more annoying!

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository (if you can figure out how).
2. Open the HTML file (it's the one that ends with .html, genius).
3. Marvel at your local browser's ability to display a web page.

## 🧙‍♂️ Usage

1. Type in two names. Try to spell them correctly; we know it's challenging.
2. Click the "Calculate" button. Take a deep breath; this is the most action you'll get all day.
3. Gasp in awe at the percentage revealed. It's almost as accurate as a horoscope!
4. If you're lucky enough to get 100% or more, enjoy the confetti. It's the closest thing to a real party you'll experience while using this app.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- If the calculator says you have 0% friendship, don't worry! It's not the calculator, you're just a terrible friend.
- If you're not seeing confetti, make sure your screen isn't covered in the tears of your loneliness.
- For any other issues, try turning it off and on again. If that doesn't work, maybe it's time to go outside and make real friends?
